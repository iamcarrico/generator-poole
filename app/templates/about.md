This is a pretty much blank theme for you to start with. Mr. Poole doesn't want to assume anything, and therefore has given you a blank slate to begin with.

The Sass files are within the ```_sass``` folder, and can be customzied there. As long as you have ```gulp serve``` running, then BrowserSync will compile and update your styles in the browser.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
